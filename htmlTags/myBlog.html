                <p>The UK has announced more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since mass testing began.
                    There were 12,872 new cases, while a further 49 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. 
                    However, the government said a technical issue meant some cases this week were not recorded at the time so these were included in Saturday's data.    
                    It comes after data earlier this week had suggested infections may be rising more slowly than in previous weeks.</p>
